*********

The KW40Z is a highly-integrated single-chip device that enables Bluetooth, Smart/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) v4.1, and IEEE 802.15.4-2011 RF connectivity for portable, extremely low-power embedded systems.

Applications include portable health care devices, wearable sports and fitness devices, AV remote controls, computer keyboards and mice, gaming controllers, access control, security systems, smart energy and home area networks.

The KW40Z MCU integrates a 2.4 GHz transceiver supporting a range of FSK/GFSK and O-QPSK modulations, an ARM Cortex-M0+ CPU, 160 KB Flash and 20 KB SRAM, BLE Link Layer hardware, 802.15.4 packet processor, hardware security and peripherals optimized to meet the requirements of the target applications.
